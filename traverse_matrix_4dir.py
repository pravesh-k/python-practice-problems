## This problem is from LeetCode numbered #733. Flood Fill

# Problem Statement: An image is represented by an m x n integer grid image 
# where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image. You are also given 
# three integers sr, sc, and newColor. You should perform a flood fill on the 
# image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc]. To perform a flood fill, consider 
# the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally (up, down, left, 
# right) to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any 
# pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), 
# and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with newColor. 
# Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.

# Costraints:
# row == image.length
# col == image[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 50
# 0 <= image[i][j], newColor < 2^16
# 0 <= sr < m
# 0 <= sc < n

        old_color = image[sr][sc]       # variable indicating the original color that 
                                        # needs to be changed when conditions met

            # neigbours lying in the 4 directions(up, down, left, right)

        # calling the recursive traverse function
        traverse(sr, sc)
